Problem:
Current agricultural workflows are decentralized, farmers rely on separate solutions for soil testing, crop advisory, weather insights, yield prediction, market pricing, and distribution. 
This lack of system integration leads to inefficiencies, revenue loss, and poor decision-making.
Solution:
With the rapid advancement of technology, agriculture no longer needs to function in fragmented silos. 
Instead of using disconnected tools for:
soil analysis 
crop monitoring
pricing
sales
we have proposed a website named as "Vithai360" which has the following features:
1.	Explore farming
    Features include:
  	Common tips about farming
2.	Crop recommendation
    Features include:
  	Recommends crops based on the soil type and the weather
3.	Weather Info
  	Features include:
    Shows the temperature and weather status of the given location
4.  Plant hygiene
    Features include:
    Includes tips about plant mainatainance and tracks the hygiene of the plant based on predefined conditions and scores the hygiene based on the user input
5.	Cost Calculator
    Features include:
    The user enters the crop type,total land area in acres,cost of seeds,fertilizer & labor..based on this input realtime yield prediction and cost analysis like profit/loss status
  	
this is our research project where it is been integrated with hardware 
the hardware will collect all the info from the farm and it is been stored using a database
these data will be analysed using the software were do data will be adden which will decrease the carbon emission 
analysing will be based on the real data collection.
a dashboard will be created which will be a usable format 

as of now we have created a software where the input is given by the user to know the next step 
In weather info we have used a set of input for now later we will integrate it with api in future
